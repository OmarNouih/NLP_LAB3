# Natural Language Processing Notebook

This notebook contains two major sections: evaluation of language models on an answers dataset for regression and on a tweets dataset for classification.

## Answers Dataset (Regression)

### Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the answers dataset and performed preprocessing steps including text normalization, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.
- Visualized the distribution of answer scores using histograms and word clouds.

### Feature Extraction
- Utilized Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF vectorization, and Word2Vec word embeddings to represent text data in numerical form.

### Regression Models
- Trained Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models.
- Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated model performance using MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
- Compared error metrics across different models.

### Error Metrics Comparison
- Presented a comparison of error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) for each regression model.
- Concluded that the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model performed the best based on the error metrics.

## Tweets Dataset (Classification)

### Data Preprocessing
- Preprocessed the Twitter dataset by removing HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, and emojis.
- Applied tokenization and stopwords removal.
- Visualized the distribution of sentiment labels using pie charts and bar plots.

### Feature Extraction
- Utilized TF-IDF vectorization, Bag-of-Words (BoW), and Word2Vec word embeddings for feature representation.

### Classification Models
- Trained Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
- Compared model performance across different metrics.

### Performance Metrics Comparison
- Presented a comparison of performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall) for each classification model.
- Concluded that the Decision Tree model performed the best overall for sentiment analysis on tweets.

### Word2Vec Model Download
- Download the Word2Vec model used in the notebook from [Google's Word2Vec Models](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300).
